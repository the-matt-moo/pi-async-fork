# pi-async-fork

`pi-async-fork` runs bounded Pi work in durable pi-fleet agents without blocking the main Pi agent.

It provides `create_fork`, `steer_fork`, and `fork_status`. Forks use a separate retained Pi session, send meaningful progress and final reports as parent steering messages, and preserve branch-scoped ownership in the parent Pi session.

Progress reports never wake an idle parent. During active work, Pi appends progress after the current turn's tool results for a later model call. Progress alone does not cause that call.

Progress reports never wake an idle agent. Final reports and terminal notices always wake the agent when idle and queue as steering while it is working. This can create one main-model turn for each staggered terminal report. The agent must process routine reports as internal work events and write user-visible text only for material communication. Historical `triggerTurn` values remain valid ledger data but do not change terminal wake behavior.

## Fork creation

`create_fork` requires `name`, `task`, and `description`. The description is a single-line, 3-to-6-word purpose summary for the user, such as `Trace login session validation`. Describe the work, not fork mechanics. The extension trims outer whitespace and rejects C0 or C1 controls and Unicode line separators `U+2028` and `U+2029`.

New fork records store `description`. The description appears only in TUI metadata. It does not change the model-visible report envelope. Creation and progress, final, and notice headers append ` · <description>` after the public fork ID. Status appends the description after a successful result. Steering headers do not change. Historical records or result messages without a description retain their current headers. Historical `fork.created` records may contain `triggerTurn`; the parser accepts it for compatibility and ignores it.

## Fork status activity

`fork_status` accepts an optional positive integer `limit`. For an active fork, it opens an independent pi-fleet replay from the start and returns an observed activity history. Without `limit`, it returns all observed mapped entries within collector output limits. With `limit`, it retains only the latest observed entries.

Collection stops after one second without an event or three seconds total, so status can take one to three seconds. The result is best effort, not a complete journal snapshot. It can miss activity during replay, stream failure, or subscriber overflow. A collection problem adds a warning but does not fail a valid state result.

The activity list preserves stream order and shows UTC timestamps with `thinking`, `message`, or `tool <name> <compact args>`. It excludes thinking content, visible message content, and tool output. Tool arguments are size-limited and redacted for secret-shaped keys, credentials in URLs, and common authorization strings. This is not a secret-safe audit log.

Automatic cleanup removes completed fork activity with the pi-fleet journal. Completed and historical forks return state and description without an activity section. The collapsed TUI header remains `fork_status <forkId> · <description>: <state>`. Expanded status output shows the observed activity section.

## Reasoning effort

Fast and balanced forks have less reasoning capability than the coordinating reader. Deep forks have more reasoning capability and use expensive compute. Capability changes the cognitive work assigned to a fork and the weight given to its evidence. It does not change scope, permissions, authority, or ownership. The coordinating reader interprets every report against the active goal and makes the decision.

Use the lowest effort that can reliably complete the task. When `effort` is omitted from `create_fork`, the extension uses TypeSafe Jev to suggest `fast`, `balanced`, or `deep` from the task description, then falls back to `balanced` if Jev is unavailable or uncertain. An explicitly supplied effort always wins. Jev uses the `pi-bifrost/jev-api-key` Windows Credential Manager entry. Use deep only when its added reasoning capability is necessary for the outcome. Do not use deep for routine evidence gathering, settled execution, duplicate agreement, or work that balanced can complete reliably. A strong deep report remains decision input, not a decision made on the reader's behalf.

## Configuration

Add this to global or project Pi settings:

```json
{
  "pi-async-fork": {
    "agentDir": "/absolute/path/to/fork-agent-profile",
    "stateDir": "/absolute/path/to/pi-fleet-state",
    "env": { "PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE": "1" },
    "fast": { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-5.6-luna", "thinking": "medium" },
    "balanced": { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-5.6-terra", "thinking": "high" },
    "deep": { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-5.6-sol", "thinking": "high" }
  }
}
```

`agentDir` is optional. Omit it, or set it to `null`, to use pi-fleet's default Pi profile. Set a non-empty path to use a dedicated fork profile. A project `agentDir: null` overrides a configured global path.

`stateDir` is optional. Omit it, or set it to `null`, to use pi-fleet's default state directory, `~/.pi-fleet`. Set a non-empty path to isolate fork state. A project `stateDir: null` overrides a configured global path.

`env` is an optional string-to-string overlay for fork Pi processes. It does not change the parent Pi process or the pi-fleet worker. A project `env` object merges by key with the global object. A project string overrides one global value, a project `null` value removes one inherited key, `env: null` clears all inherited values, and `env: {}` keeps inherited values. Omit `env`, or resolve no entries, to pass no overlay.

`PATH` and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` are reserved. Names must be non-empty and cannot contain `=` or a null byte. Values must be strings without null bytes; empty strings are valid. pi-fleet persists values in agent state and backups, then applies them to Pi startup and recovery. Do not use `env` for secrets. Existing forks retain their recorded environment until destruction; changes affect only new forks. pi-async-fork does not duplicate environment data in its session ledger.

A dedicated fork profile controls child resources and extensions. When the default profile loads `pi-async-fork` inside a child, an extension-owned session marker prevents all three async-fork tools from starting or managing forks. The tools remain visible so an attempted call can return a task-focused error.

After adding or changing this configuration, run `/reload` or restart Pi. Until valid configuration exists, the extension stays inactive and its tools return the configuration error.

## Operational limits

Forks share the parent project working directory. Concurrent writes are unsafe without separate workspace isolation, so use asynchronous forks for read-only work unless the caller coordinates writes.

The child-session marker blocks `create_fork`, `steer_fork`, and `fork_status` inside async forks. It does not block direct pi-fleet CLI commands through a shell. Use a restricted profile or sandbox when workers must not have shell access to pi-fleet.

The extension retains child session files under the parent session directory after normal completion. If creation cleanup cannot destroy an unregistered pi-fleet agent, it also retains that child session and returns the agent name and cleanup error. Inspect it with `pif status <name>`, or add `--state-dir <path>` for custom state. Destroy only that named agent with `pif destroy <name>`, or add `--state-dir <path>`.

A terminal fork waits ten seconds for delayed activity replay before it classifies its remaining report as final or sends a no-result notice. This wait is a first-version heuristic. Removing or disabling the extension does not destroy active pi-fleet agents, so inspect the configured state directory before rollback.

## Progress reports

Forks remain one-off workers. A multi-phase task must report only after a completed phase produces a concrete, evidence-backed finding. Plans, intended sources, and unstarted work do not qualify. An intermediate report must state what the evidence changes, material uncertainty, remaining work, and the next action. It must not imply that the task is complete. A later report must add evidence that changes the recommendation, scope, risk, or next action, resolve a named uncertainty, or complete a distinct phase. New citations, restated findings, and repeated next actions do not qualify. Forks do not report simple one-phase work, raw activity, elapsed time, or waiting. They automatically destroy themselves after the final report or a terminal notice.

Each visible checkpoint and final report uses `## Output` and `## Learnings`. Intermediate reports stay short and focused. Source URLs can appear inline. This brevity requirement does not apply to final reports, which retain the task-adapted report contract. To continue one Pi run, an intermediate report must include the next necessary tool call in the same assistant response. A text-only report with no next tool call is final.

The extension holds each visible child message until later pi-fleet activity proves that the child continued. It sends that report as progress only while the latest monitored pi-fleet status is `working`. If terminal status remains for ten seconds, only the latest remaining message is final. It sends these model-visible envelopes:

```text
<forkId>:

This is an intermediate progress report. The fork is still working and can receive steering.

<report>
```

```text
<forkId>:

This is the final report. The fork finished and can no longer receive steering. Treat this report as an internal work event. Do not write user-visible text only because it arrived.

<report>
```

A terminal notice says that the fork finished and can no longer receive steering, then instructs the agent to treat it as an internal work event without user-visible acknowledgment. The TUI renders only clean headers: `● fork <forkId> · <description>: working` for progress, `✓ fork <forkId> · <description>: completed` for final reports, and `⚠ fork <forkId> · <description>: terminal` for notices. The description is omitted for historical messages that lack it. The model-only status sentence does not appear in expanded Markdown.

Progress and final reports use pi-fleet cursors plus the public fork ID and immutable agent ID for duplicate suppression. Each report remains scoped to its owner branch. An inactive owner branch receives no delivery. If the fork is still working when that branch becomes active, missing progress can replay. If the fork is terminal, only its latest report becomes final. Progress does not add `fork.created` or `fork.destroyed` records.

`pi.sendMessage()` has no delivery acknowledgement. This provides at-least-once replay with cursor duplicate suppression after a persisted parent custom message, not exactly-once delivery. A parent process can still lose a queued progress message before Pi consumes and persists it.
